# ModelCIF

[ModelCIF](mmcif_ma.dic) provides the data representation for describing 
structural models of macromolecules derived from computational methods. 
ModelCIF is developed and maintained by the [ModelCIF Working Group](http://wwpdb-beta.rcsb.org/task/modelcif).

ModelCIF data standards is used by the [ModelArchive](https://www.modelarchive.org) 
and [MODBASE](https://modbase.compbio.ucsf.edu) repositories. These models may be derived from already 
existing structural templates (also known as homology modeling or comparative modeling methods) 
or can be obtained from *ab initio* modeling methods. 

[ModelCIF](mmcif_ma.dic) is an extension of the [PDBx/mmCIF](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org) 
dictionary. The [PDBx/mmCIF](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org) dictionary is used by the [wwPDB](http://www.wwpdb.org) to
archive structural models of macromolecules determined using X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscory
and three-dimensional Electron Microscopy.
