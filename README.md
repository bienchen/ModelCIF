# MA-dictionary

The [MA-dictionary](mmcif_ma.dic) provides the data representation for describing 
structural models of macromolecules derived from computational methods. 

These structural models are archived in the [ModelArchive](https://www.modelarchive.org).
These models may be derived from already existing structural templates (also known as 
homology modeling or comparative modeling methods) or can be obtained from *ab initio* 
modeling methods. 

The [MA-dictionary](mmcif_ma.dic) is an extension of the [PDBx/mmCIF](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org) 
dictionary. The [PDBx/mmCIF](http://mmcif.wwpdb.org) dictionary is used by the [wwPDB](http://www.wwpdb.org) to
archive structural models of macromolecules determined using X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscory
and three-dimensional Electron Microscopy.
